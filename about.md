Hi. My name is Jay Hannah. I'm a computer nerd with too many hobbies currently 
living in Omaha, Nebraska, USA. I've been listening to podcasts since before iTunes 
knew what they were. Big fan. 

I've had lots of interesting conversations with people about their jobs, projects, hobbies, 
politics, religion, and other topics that may or may not be safe for polite company.

In January 2015 I bought a cool microphone. 
Let's see if anybody will go "on the record" with me. And if anyone wants to listen.

I commissioned my awesome friends [Cara](https://twitter.com/CaraHeacock) and
[Michaela](https://twitter.com/DreamingAlyce) to whip up this logo for the podcast:

For no reason at all, here's me on a fishing boat in Indonesia in 2014 
[scuba diving my grandpa's WWII ship](http://usshoustondive.com). I told you 
I have too many hobbies.
