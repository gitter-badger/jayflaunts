Jay and Dave talk about minimum wage and the future of work. As jobs like drivers
and cashiers (and eventually programmers and network engineers) are eliminated, 
what does the future of work look like? Do we need a social safety net?
What form should that take?
Univeral Basic Income, Living Wage and other terms are used, 
probably incorrectly.
