What if you never had to worry about food again? 
[Nick Nisi](http://twitter.com/nicknisi) and Jay chat about
[Soylent](http://soylent.me), a "food product (classified as a food, not a supplement, by the FDA) designed for use as a staple meal by all adults. Each serving of Soylent provides maximum nutrition with minimum effort."

* Jay talked a lot about primal/paleo, strongly recommends 
[The Primal BluePrint](http://www.primalblueprint.com/books/the-primal-blueprint-book/),
assumes Mark Sisson would not approve of Soylent. :)
* [Soylent Green](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070723/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) 
is people!!
