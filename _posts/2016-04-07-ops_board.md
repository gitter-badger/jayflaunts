If you live in Distict 3, Alex would appreciate your vote this November. 
We talk about his motivations to run, how OPS works, and how to improve it.
Also how PTAs/PTOs work, last October's sex ed public 
meeting that turned ugly, and student population forecasting 
frustrations.

Beyond school stuff, we also chatted about the Keystone XL pipeline,
Open/Nebraska, and Jay's imminent hobo lifestyle.
