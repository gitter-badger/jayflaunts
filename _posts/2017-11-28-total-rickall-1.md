In this very silly and pointless episode four of us play the
[Total Rickall Card Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194232/rick-and-morty-total-rickall-card-game).
We enthusiastically recommend that game and 
[Rick and Morty S2E4](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832262/?ref_=ttep_ep4), from which it came.

In the intro Brad explains why posting this episode at all is pretty pointless. 

Who knows why anyone enjoys anything on the Internet? Mysteries abound. The Dude abides.
