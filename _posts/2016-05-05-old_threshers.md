Jay's first week living in an RV full time, camping at the
[Old Threshers Reunion](http://oldthreshers.com/) campground. This
year's reunion is September 1st - 5th in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. 
With over 2,000 exhibits & attractions you should not miss it. 
30-35 thousand visitors attended in 2015. It's an amazing event.

Jay talks with Terry McWilliams, CEO of the association, who generously 
gave some of his time on a busy Thursday morning. Terry does local radio
spots every week, so is much better at podcasting than Jay is.  :)

Jay's parents and grandparents are from Mt. Pleasant. 
He has many years of fond memories attending the Old Threshers reunion with them,
and was very excited to spend a week on the grounds.
