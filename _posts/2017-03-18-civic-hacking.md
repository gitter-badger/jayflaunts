* Apologies to [Lora Mae Frecks](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-public-affairs-and-community-service/public-administration/academics/doctoral-student-profiles/lora-mae-frecks.php) who did all the data gathering work for the Open/Nebraska localboards project. 10m into this podcast, Jay incorrectly cites credit to the wrong person. Jay is an idiot and you should not listen to his blathering. :)
