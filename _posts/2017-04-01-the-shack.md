Yay lots of religion and politics! Jay and his mom and dad talk about the book 
and movie "The Shack" after Jay rants about a frustrating conversation he had with 
a gentlemen recently. We also discuss a talk we attended in downtown Kansas City
by Mark Gerzon, author of The Reunited States of America: How We Can Bridge the
Partisan Divide.
