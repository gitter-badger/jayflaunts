[Hi there. My name's Matt Wynn.](http://mattwynn.net/) Iâ€™m a web developer and reporter with 
the Omaha World-Herald. I write stories that uncover problems, advocate for the open web and 
build apps that let people make the news their own.

Projects:

* [Omaha Crime Report](http://omahacrimereport.com/) - Tracking the latest crimes 
reported in your neighborhood so you can stay safe.
* [Public pay](http://dataomaha.com/salaries) - Search the salaries of 14,382 employees at 15 
public agencies in Nebraska.
* [Prison scandal](http://dataomaha.com/prison) - Tracking inmates released early from Nebraska prisons

[Legistlative Bill 432](http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/104/PDF/Intro/LB432.pdf):

* [Senator withdraws bill that unintentionally repeals citizens' public records rights](http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/senator-withdraws-bill-that-unintentionally-repeals-citizens-public-records-rights/article_ae59958d-34e1-597a-b688-6576d46b8773.html#.VMvAGn8leHA.twitter)
* "If you picture me reading this bill with a thoughtful face, you are incorrect. It makes me livid.

* Doesn't look so bad? "Well, may codify goofy practice of making data == PDFs. 
Second, eliminates free inspection of records."
