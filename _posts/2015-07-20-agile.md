[Andre Simones](https://twitter.com/asimones), an agile coach and trainer with 
[One80 Services](http://one80services.com/) walks Jay through Agile
best practices, including effort estimation and velocity metrics known
as Story Points. Jay thought Agile practices were only used in computer
programming, but he was wrong!  

This episode might be fairly Inside Baseball, but we do a soft intro at
the beginning, so hopefully anyone can listen, regardless of your level
of experience in tech. :)
