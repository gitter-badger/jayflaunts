Jay's pre-interview notes:

Recent news events have left me wondering:
How do prosecutors, who work on the same team with the police all day every day,
stay impartial when the defendant is a police officer?

As a rambunctious teenager I experienced tension with police on two occasions.
In my adult life I've had no trouble at all. 
Police have always been very helpful and professional.
I assume the fact that I'm a boring, law-abiding, stable, middle class white guy
plays at least some role in that history.

I assume law enforcement is a challenging, difficult job that often goes 
under-appreciated. I assume most officers are doing excellent work. 
But inevitably, mistakes will be made. Some of those mistakes will 
result in loss of life. 

When people die during police action are the police subject to the same
prosecution an average citizen is? More? Less? I try to 
imagine being a prosecutor who relies on police every day to do my job. 
Would I not have enormous incentive to make sure I don't alienate the
police force by prosecuting an officer?

How can prosecutors be impartial? Are they? Does the article below offer evidence 
that they're not? Are police being held to a fair standard? Why are grand
jury results so different when the defendent is a police officer? Does that
mean the system is broken?
