Jay's grandfather, Earl C. Humphrey, served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was
serving aboard the USS Houston CA-30, out to sea, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. 
In this special edition episode, Earl recounts his time as a prisoner of war (POW) working the Burma-Thai 'Death' Railway, and stories from the homestead in southeast Iowa.

Intro script:

Hello and welcome to a special episode of Jay Flaunts His Ignorance, the podcast. In this episode, you'll hear my grandfather Earl C. Humphrey recount some of his experiences during World War II, and stories from home in southeast Iowa.

This episode is labelled "Earl 8". If you haven't listened to the previous episodes labelled "Earl 3" and "Earl 4", I recommend you go back and start with those. His war stories begin with the sinking of the USS Houston CA-30.

In 1980 my grandfather had a stroke which effected his speech. His speech mostly recovered, but you'll hear some slurring in these recordings. In 1982 my father Jim Hannah sat down with him and recorded 11 audio tapes, capturing his oral history.

This is one of those tapes. This tape is labelled "Earl 8". Earl recounts some Prisoner of War stories, and stories from the homestead in southeast Iowa.

I hope you enjoy hearing my grandfather tell his story. In his own words. If you like this episode, there are more I can post. Let me know on twitter.com/jayflaunts. Thank you. 

So, here it is. My father interviewing my grandfather in 1982.

Outro script:

And that's it. That's where the tape labelled "Earl 8" ends. Thanks for listening. If you'd like to hear more, let me know on twitter.com/jayflaunts. Bye for now.

Jay's note to self: This recording is actually earl8 followed by earl7.
