Jay and [Hasani Hunter](https://twitter.com/hasanihunter) chat about
all types of Prohibition: drugs, alcohol, guns, tobacco, gambling,
prostitution. Does prohibition work? When is it a good / bad idea? 
Is Jay a massive hypocrite when it comes to drugs vs. guns?

Jay even yapped about recent California legislation affecting transgender
people under Title 9. Brace yourself.

* [Radiolab Presents: Invisibilia](http://www.radiolab.org/story/invisibilia/) - Alix tells us a story about two very basic categories: boy and girl. We've heard lots of stories about the sometimes blurry boundaries between boy and girl, but Alix introduces us to someone who experiences those categories in a way that was totally, completely new to us.
